    etc. Default=-1.
  }
  \item{aalbin}{
    The length bin for which multi-panel plots of the fit
    to conditional age-at-length data will be produced for all years.
    Useful to see if growth curves are ok, or to see the information on
    year classes move through the conditional data. Default=-1.

  }
  \item{minnbubble}{
    number of unique x values before adding buffer. see ?bubble3 for more info.
  }
  \item{pntscalar}{
    maximum bubble size for bubble plots; each plot scaled independently
    based on this maximum size and the values plotted. Often some plots
    look better with one value and others with a larger or smaller
    value. Default=2.6
  }
  \item{pwidth}{
    default width of plots printed to files in units of \code{punits}. Default=7.
  }
  \item{pheight}{
    default height width of plots printed to files in units of \code{punits}. Default=7.
  }
  \item{punits}{
    units for \code{pwidth} and \code{pheight}. Can be "px" (pixels), "in" (inches), "cm" or "mm". Default="in".

  }
  \item{cohortlines}{
    optional vector of birth years for cohorts for which to add growth curves to numbers at length bubble plots
  }
  \item{labels}{
    vector of labels for plots (titles and axis labels)
  }
  \item{printmkt}{
    show market categories in plot titles?
  }
  \item{printsex}{
    show gender in plot titles?
  }

    fix the dimensions at maxrows by maxcols or resize based on number of
    years of data
  }
  \item{fixdims2}{
    fix the dimensions at maxrows by maxcols in aggregate plots or
    resize based on number of fleets
  }
  \item{maxneff}{
    the maximum value to include on plots of input and effective sample
    size. Occasionally a calculation of effective N blows up to very large
    numbers, rendering it impossible to observe the relationship for other
    data. Default=5000.
  }

    return updates of function progress to the R GUI?
  }
  \item{scalebins}{
